After identifying missing values in a paired dataset created according to the pairing principle, we create patient scenarios to estimate the missing values logically. Each scenario contains alternative values and criteria, which we call reconstruction rules as follows: RULE#1: If a discharge is not due to death, it is considered a recovery; RULE #2: If possible, substitute values from the "ventilation" table; RULE#3: If extubation is the last procedure, fill in the extubation value with the discharge time if there's no death, else with the time of death; RULE#4: If death occurs more than 48 hours after extubation, categorize as extubation non-failure; RULE#5: If the death occurs within 48 hours of extubation, or if the time of death is earlier than the extubation time, categorized as death; RULE#6: If the time to reintubation is not calculated due to a missing value, replace it with the value from the ventilation table; RULE#7: If cannot be replaced by the value in the ventilation table, check the time difference between the intubation time or extubation time of the current row and the next row, and if the value exists within 48 hours, classify it as extubation failure. If the value does not exist, it is categorized as "Unclassifiable."
