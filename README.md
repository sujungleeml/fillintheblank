We aimed to extract adult patients who experienced extubation from the MIMIC-IV database. Intubation and extubation are procedures that can occur more than once during hospitalization and display characteristics of being paired. For these adult patients, we employed a strategy involving patient scenario works that checked the temporal order and logical links of intubation/extubation data, and seven reconstruction rules for handling missing values.
